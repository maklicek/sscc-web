SSCC – SolarSpace Carbon Cycle
Integrated energy infrastructure for long-term stability
What is SSCC
SSCC is an integrated energy infrastructure concept designed for systems with a high share of variable renewable energy.
It connects:
•	renewable electricity,
•	stable thermal sources,
•	chemical energy carriers,
•	and predictive control
into a single, coordinated system.
The goal is not to maximize instantaneous efficiency,
but to ensure energy availability over time under real physical and grid constraints.

The problem SSCC addresses
Modern energy systems face three structural challenges:
•	Temporal mismatch between generation and demand
(energy is produced when it is not needed, and missing when it is)
•	Grid limitations
(curtailment, congestion, and reduced operational flexibility)
•	Lack of long-term storage
(batteries work in hours, not days or weeks)
SSCC addresses these challenges at the system level, not by adding isolated components.

How SSCC works (high level)
SSCC operates across multiple time scales:
•	Seconds to hours
Fast stabilization and protection (typically supported by BESS)
•	Hours to days
Thermal storage and load balancing
•	Days to weeks (or longer)
Chemical energy carriers (e.g. hydrogen, ammonia) as long-term reserves
Energy is converted, stored, and released based on predicted conditions,
not only on instantaneous availability.

BESS and SSCC – complementary roles
Battery energy storage systems (BESS) and SSCC are not competing solutions.
•	BESS provides fast response and short-term stability
•	SSCC provides long-term availability and resilience
Combined, they form a layered system where:
•	batteries handle speed,
•	SSCC handles time,
•	and control logic coordinates both.

Operational scenarios
Renewable surplus
Excess energy is absorbed, converted, and stored instead of curtailed.
Long-term deficit
Stored thermal and chemical energy maintains continuity of supply.
Grid outage or crisis mode
The system enters a degraded but controlled operating state, preserving critical functions and buying time for recovery.

Design philosophy
SSCC is based on a few explicit principles:
•	systems must be stable, not perfect
•	decisions must be predictable and explainable
•	long-term resilience is more important than short-term optimization
SSCC is not a universal solution,
but a systemic framework for regions, industry, and critical infrastructure.
